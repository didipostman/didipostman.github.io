Abstract :

I have a problem to learn chinese. I found it difficult but I asked myself : Chinese
people find learning Arabic, English, French, Deutsch etc. difficult too.
So I decided to find a solution for beginners to learn languages.

The new way

The new method is based on learning by Keyboard and text to Speech.
The teacher shows a letter to his pupils and read it twice and then asks his students to
find it on the keyboard and they should press the corrspondent key and hit the baffle.
Then they compare the sound response of text to Speech with what the teacher
taught them.

Step by Step, letter by letter and then small sentences the students will learn the
basics of the languages essentially how to read. A course of writing must be taken in
parallel with what they read.

Conclusion
The prototype is simple to understand, download it and hit index.html and just choose
a language, hit the key, then the baffle and mimic what the app returns to you. You
will learn the basis. But no grammar. Enjoy it.

Instead downloading it the prototype App You can try the protoype App at This Following link https://didipostman.github.io/
